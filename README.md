# COMP5327_Final_Project
This program is developed for the Final Project of COMP5327 Course.

## Project Description
Some computer programs can be solved both in polynomial time (O(Nk)) and linear time (O(N)). In this project, we tried to develop a 
program that converts an O(N2) code to O(N) code by using the RNN model. The overall workflow of the program can be seen in the diagram.
